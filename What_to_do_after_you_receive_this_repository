1. Clone the Repository:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository(this is where you'll be working locally) using `cd path`
- Run the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/LiquidSilver1011/EduProject`

This will clone the repository into your current directory (.) and include all the files and history.

2. Check for Remote:

Confirm that the remote repository has been added. Run:
`git remote -v`
This should show the URL of the repository.

3. Install dependencies:
Run `npm install`

4. You can now start working on the project. Anytime you made a change and want to push it onto the github repository, push like so:

`git add .`
`git rm -r --cached node_modules`
`git commit -m "Your Commit message"`
`git push origin main`

5. Anytime you want to pull changes that others made and aren't updated on your local repository, run:
`git pull origin main`
